After handpicking the best of all 3 books and from the other sources. The images were edidted to remove "noise" and to make the images more clear. 

No resizing was done to the images except for cropping the images to remove the white space around the images in most of the images.

## Dataset format

A zip file is then created with all the images and uploaded to vkolagotla.gitlab.io pages on gitlab to make it publicly available as this repo is not public at the time of model training and i did not wanna set up public pages for this repo.
